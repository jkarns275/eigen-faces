project4/: code for the project requirments, also contains result figures
att_faces/: face images
tupip/: non-face images
autoencoder/: bonus part, written in python
to run the code, run project4/project4.m it takes 5-10 minutes to finish the run

some important 
face identification accuracy: acc_rate_c
face recognition accuracy: acc_rate_f
avg_d: L2 error for face reconstruction, row1: SVD, row2: eigen(XXT)
k_variance: # of eigenfaces with different variance, row1: SVD, row2: eigen(XXT)
